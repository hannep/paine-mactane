When you need crates hauled onto or off ships, you need a dockworker. When you need to beat a Martian crewmember to a pulp after the Cant’s destruction, you need an angry dockworker. Kowmang gotta die some time!

This was one of our first-ever April Fool's Day cocktails, and Brian Graham, who played this iconic role, was delighted to have a drink created in his honor. 

At the time, we thought making drinks for extremely minor characters with few lines and no names was a good joke. Now, we've done a whole series of Scene Stealers, and the Angry Dockworker would be top of that list.

#### Instructions:

Pour all ingredients into a large shot glass. Stir. Then slam it. Hard. Angrily, even.
