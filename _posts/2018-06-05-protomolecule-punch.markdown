The Epstein Drive’s blue glow gave humanity the entire Solar System. Now, people face a new type of blue glow: that of the alien Protomolecule that re-shapes everything it touches. From the horrors it wreaked on Eros to the astounding events of Venus, the Protomolecule’s blue glow is a sure sign that something amazing is happening.

When all the Screaming Firehawks get together, amazing things happen.

We've served this drink as a joking Blue Meanie at the [Belter Bar](http://twitter.com/BelterBar) - unlike the book version, with its unhealthy combo of stimulants and alcohol, this one has fresh fruit and electrolytes. 

This drink is nonalcoholic, but if you feel like partying harder, adding a little vodka doesn't hurt.

#### Instructions:

Mix all ingredients in a punch bowl with ice. Garnish with blackberries and blueberries. Serve with a smile at any event where Screaming Firehawks are thirsty.
