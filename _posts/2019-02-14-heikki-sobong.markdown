Heikki Sobong was a Belter courier who was captured carrying stealth technology, accused of OPA allegiance, and mercilessly tortured by Chrisjen Avasarala. Even while being interrogated, he was calm and well-spoken, with an indomitable will. He engineered his own death by acceleration rather than give up his secrets.
