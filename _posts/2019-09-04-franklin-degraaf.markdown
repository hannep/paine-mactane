The UN ambassador to Mars, Franklin DeGraaf was a friend of Avasarala’s father, and also of Chrisjen herself since she was a girl. He admires Martian society’s unity of purpose and its dream of “turning a lifeless rock into a garden,” and he and his husband plan to retire to Mariner Valley. His trust in Avasarala costs him dearly.

In our hint for DeGraaf, we described him as: solemn, idealistic, genial, loyal, and trusting.

The yellow rose can be a symbol of betrayal, and is appropriate for how he is treated.

#### Instructions:

<strong>Infused Wine:</strong> Using a vegetable peeler, zest 3 blood oranges and 1 lemon, avoiding as much white pith as possible. Place zest in a bowl with ½ cup white sugar, muddle, and set aside for 30 minutes. Add the mixture to 1 bottle red wine along with 1 cup roughly chopped, pitted cherries, 1 cup dried hibiscus petals, and the juice of the oranges and lemon. Allow to infuse overnight in the refrigerator, then strain.

<strong>Cocktail:</strong> Pour all ingredients into a cocktail shaker with ice and shake until cold. Strain into a chilled coupe and garnish with a rose petal.
