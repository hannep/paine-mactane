Like many people on Ceres, Evita Jung is into slingshot racing, and slingshot racers. But having her boyfriend away for months on end gets to be boring. Evita is not the type of woman to sit around pining for her man; she won’t wait forever. But given a truly unique feat of gravity-assisted skill, she could be wooed back.

This drink is designed to complement the Cocktail 86, [Manéo Jung-Espinoza](/cocktails/2019/05/30/maneo-jung-espinoza), as a shot and a chaser, or sipped side-by-side. 

Optional: Additionally, take a shot of protein shake to represent Manéo's sexy beratna, a.k.a. Thigh Guy.

#### Instructions:

<strong>Caramel Syrup:</strong> Heat 2 cups sugar and 1 cup water in a deep saucepan until the mixture reaches 348°F. Immediately remove from heat and add 1 cup hot water. Return to heat and stir constantly until the caramel is completely dissolved and the mixture is smooth, about 1 minute. 

<strong>Cocktail:</strong> Pour all ingredients into a cocktail shaker with ice and shake until cold. Strain into a chilled rocks glass over pebble ice and garnish with espresso powder and a dried pineapple slice.
