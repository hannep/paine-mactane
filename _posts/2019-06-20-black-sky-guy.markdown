The leader of the OPA Black Sky faction on Tycho, Nikil is called “Black Sky Guy” by Drummer after his run-in with Fred Johnson. Promoting bold action against the Inners, Nikil touts Black Sky’s violent achievements and derides Johnson as “an Earther playing Belter.” His oratory sways the crowd, but not Johnson, who kicks him out an airlock.
