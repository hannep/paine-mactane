NAOMI: We need to give the ship a new name to complete the override.

ALEX: Screaming Firehawk.

HOLDEN: Yeah, let’s advertise that we’re a gunship.

ALEX: Flying Alamo.

HOLDEN: No!

Instead of that (legitimately salvaged) Martian gunship, the name “Screaming Firehawks” now refers to the legions of fans of The Expanse. This drink is for all of us.

This drink was specifically created to be easy to make at home or at almost any bar. We wanted everyone to be able to drink and share it! 

If you want a non-alcoholic option, we suggest swapping in a good ginger ale or ginger beer for the bourbon and rum. And a future drink in the "Save The Expanse!" series will be entirely non-alcoholic; we truly do want to include ALL Screaming Firehawks.

#### Instructions:

Mix all ingredients together in a shot glass. Lift it high, shout “Yam seng!” or “Save The Expanse!” and throw it back in one shot.
