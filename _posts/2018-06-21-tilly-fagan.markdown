Tilly Fagan is a rich socialite and friend of the daughters of the Mao family. Her wealth and connections have gotten her onto the Thomas Prince ‘s voyage to the Ring. Her “jaded party girl” persona conceals deep empathy and a keen ability to understand other people.

It's not easy to taste the gin in this drink, but it does give it some serious backbone - much like Tilly's got more to her than first meets the eye.

We recommend a very dry champagne in this. The rest of it is already sweet enough, and the dry champagne helps round out the flavor profile.

Garnish this drink like you're trying to impress the Mao family with your bling!

#### Instructions:

<strong> Butterfly Pea Flower Syrup:</strong> Bring 1 cup water & 1 cup sugar to boil. Add 2 cups butterfly pea flowers and allow to steep for 15 minutes. Strain & let cool.

<strong>Cocktail:</strong> Put all ingredients into an ice-filled mixing glass. Stir briefly, then strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Top with an equal amount of champagne. Garnish with pineapple, strawberry, and lime peel.
