Mei Meng is the daughter of Praxidike, the botanist, and knows all of Ganymede’s plants by their binomial names. Her immune system disorder is managed by medical science, but attracts the attention of Protogen and embroils her in a sinister scheme as she discovers that her doctor is not what he seems.

For us, the most fun thing about making cocktails is mixing & blending flavors, so we're happy to do a non-alcoholic drink for Mei. The hibiscus flowers relate to her botanical knowledge. And we love how the bright colors echo Misko & Marisko on her backpack!
