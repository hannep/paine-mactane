The MCRN *Kittur Chennamma* was a patrol destroyer that was disabled by UNN forces. The *Roci* crew scavenged it for supplies and found 3 surviving Martian ensigns. After their attempt to take over the *Roci* was thwarted, the ensigns agreed to take the K.C. back to the Martian navy and convince Captain Kirino to pass a message about Errinwright’s plot to Admiral Souther.

This drink packs a surprising wallop for a small destroyer - much like its crew, who nearly managed to take over the *Roci* when they were captured.

This drink's fiery cinnamon kick symbolizes the crew's boldness - who can forget Ensign Loftis' intense standoff with Bobbie, Alex, and Naomi? Hazelnut symbolizes wisdom in Irish legend, so we added Frangelico for the crew's eventual recognition of the true threat to Mars.

We were almost ready to post this drink on Thursday, using Fireball cinnamon-flavored whiskey instead of a homemade cinnamon infusion, but on our last test we detected an artificial aftertaste we didn't like. We went back to the drawing board!

We hardly see the *KC* itself at all during the show - we mostly see its crew. So our drink pays homage to that crew's resilience and spirit. One major exception is the chai bitters, which are a shout-out to the ship's namesake, the Rani of Kittur, who resisted British rule.
