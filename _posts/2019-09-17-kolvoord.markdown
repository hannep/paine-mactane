Kolvoord is the chief science officer aboard the UNN _Thomas Prince_ on the expedition to the Ring, deeply curious about the mysterious artifact and the space beyond it. He persuades Ashford to authorize his explosive experiment to probe the Slow Zone and Ring Station, putting every human and ship in the Slow Zone in grave danger.

In our hint for Kolvoord, we described him as: explorative, reckless, persuasive, shortsighted, and mediocre.
