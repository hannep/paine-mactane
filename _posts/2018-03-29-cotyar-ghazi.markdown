Cotyar Ghazi (note: we know his last name now!) is an intelligence operative with decades of experience in the UN military and the corporate sector. Recruited by Avasarala as her agent, he acts as her eyes and ears, and is ready to defend her in combat situations when necessary. 

This drink combines the spy's intensity and complexity with the genuine affection he clearly has for Avasarala, and later for Bobbie. Sumac tastes sharp and a little sour, and is a great drink garnish and food ingredient.

#### Instructions:

Put all ingredients into a mixing glass and stir with ice. Coat the rim of a rocks glass with sumac, add ice cubes and strain the drink into it.
