Dimitri Havelock, a rookie Star Helix cop on Ceres Station, posesses an earnest dedication to his duty that can’t be suppressed. An Earther, he knows that he’ll never truly fit in among the Belter citizens, but he works hard to  understand and empathize with them. 

Havelock's sweetness shines through in this drink, and his complicated relationship with his Earther roots adds depth with herbs and nuts. 

Though Laird's Applejack is technically an apple brandy, we don't recommend varying. Other brandies (like Calvados) gave a much weaker result.
