The Xinglong was a prospecting rock hopper owned by Diogo Harari’s uncle Mateo. Though messy inside, it was Mateo’s pride and joy, as well as his home. When the Martian Navy boarded and ordered Mateo to divert onto a course that would leave them stranded without fuel, Mateo instead slung his load of rocks at the Martian cruiser - which retaliated by destroying the Xinglong.
