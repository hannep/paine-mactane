Melas Kamal is the young son of Alex, the Rocinante’s pilot. Already a staunch, patriotic Martian, he sees his absent father as a warrior who left Mars to protect him and his mother. He dreams of fighting alongside Alex when he grows up. Smart and driven, he doesn’t let his mother’s disapproval stop him from sending Alex a personal message of love and support.
