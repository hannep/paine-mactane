Dr. Praxidike Meng is a botanist on Ganymede, working to create more efficient soybeans. When his daughter Mei is abducted during the Battle of Ganymede, his search for her forces him to face interplanetary war and internal conflict that test his natural optimism and humanity. 

This drink was always going to be intensely botanical - we couldn't resist including Prax's life's work. It tastes smooth and balanced, but is unexpectedly strong - like him.
