Manéo Jung-Espinoza has been breaking records all across the Outer Planets in his slingshot racing pod, the [*¿Y Qué?*](/cocktails/2018/12/09/y-que/) It requires spending a lot of time away from Ceres, but he still remembers to call his girlfriend every once in a while. When slowly building a name for himself isn’t enough, Néo sets out to make history. 

This drink is designed to complement the Cocktail 87, [Evita Jung](/cocktails/2019/05/30/evita-jung/), as a shot and a chaser, or sipped side-by-side. 

Optional: Additionally, take a shot of protein shake to represent Manéo's sexy beratna, a.k.a. Thigh Guy.

#### Instructions:

<strong>Caramel Syrup:</strong> Heat 2 cups sugar and 1 cup water in a deep saucepan until the mixture reaches 348°F. Immediately remove from heat and add 1 cup hot water. Return to heat and stir constantly until the caramel is completely dissolved and the mixture is smooth, about 1 minute. 

<strong>Cocktail:</strong> Pour all ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until cold. Double strain into a chilled shot glass rimmed with powdered freeze-dried raspberries.
