tweet_text: Avasarala's drink of choice is the Gin and Tonic. On the Guanshiyin, she schemed and drank fancy gin like there was no tomorrow - and she had reason to worry there might not be. Here's our version of her jet fuel.

> “Avasarala sipped her gin and tonic while the threads of implication wove   and rewove themselves.”

<cite>Caliban’s War, Chapter 18 </cite>

> “Her heart was beating faster than usual and she could feel thoughts swimming just under the ice of her conscious mind. She felt like someone could press an ear to her skull and listen to her brain humming...
‘You want some tea?’
‘Gin,’ she said, engaging the camera on her terminal. ‘We’re celebrating.’”

<cite>Caliban’s War, Chapter 37</cite>

This is stronger both in taste (syrup-to-seltzer) and just plain gin ratio than most G&Ts, and we suspect Avasarala would like it that way.

We made our version with Jack Rudy's classic tonic syrup, but there are other good ones on the market.

"Mao’s private-label gin was excellent, even without the lime twist." *Caliban's War* mentions that there were no limes on the *Guanshiyin*, leading us to believe Avasarala normally takes them with a twist.

#### Instructions:

Stir tonic syrup and gin together in an ice-filled rocks glass. Top up glass with seltzer and stir again. Garnish with a lime twist.
