Martian Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant Bobbie Draper is one of the best the corps has to offer: brave, tough, disciplined, and highly skilled. She dreams of the day Mars will have an ocean. While she is unswervingly loyal to Mars, she sees the worth in Earthers and Belters too, and her alliances with them help humanity as a whole.

In our hint for Bobbie Draper, we said her favorite musical would be _Mulan_, and quoted the line "Once you find your center, you are sure to win!"
