Despite having risen to the highest office of governmental power, UN Secretary-General Gillis is not truly in control. Having given up his ideals in exchange for power, he is easily led - and misled - by Sadavir Errinwright. 

Definitely don't stint on the bitters, and definitely express the lemon twist before dropping it in - otherwise, this drink is too sweet and not well-rounded enough. (Much like the Secretary-General himself.)

A Twitter commenter suggested that this appear on bar menus as "The Bobblehead."
