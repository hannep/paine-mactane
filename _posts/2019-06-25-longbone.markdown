tweet_text: Tall, skinny, and mean, he educates Havelock about Miller's Belter "tell". The actor antagonizes Miller believably, then spews a beautiful string of Belter curses as he is dragged off. Wish we knew his name!

The only name we have for the man who gets up in [Havelock](/cocktails/2017/10/31/dimitri-havelock/) and [Miller](/cocktails/2018/05/31/josephus-miller/)’s faces in a Ceres bar is “Longbone” — normally an epithet for spindly Belters, attenuated from a lifetime in low-G. He interrupts them to tell [Havelock](/cocktails/2017/10/31/dimitri-havelock/) about the spurs at the top of [Miller](/cocktails/2018/05/31/josephus-miller/)’s spine. The conversation then goes rapidly downhill from there.
