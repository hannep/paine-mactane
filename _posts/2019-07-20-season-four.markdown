Season Four of _The Expanse_ is the result of tireless work by the Save _The Expanse_ team, all the dedicated fans who helped with the show’s rescue, and the talented people who create it. The Season Four release date announcement is cause for celebration by Screaming Firehawks everywhere!

We really wanted this drink to be something anyone can make, but with an [#ExpanseCocktails](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ExpanseCocktails) twist. We think the mezcal really adds an extra dimension to the drink, and reminds us that that Season 4 will be a Western, but if you can't access any, the drink will still be tasty and celebratory. We used San Pellegrino's blood orange soda, but their standard orange is also fine. The clementine is too sweet, though.

#### Instructions:

Rinse a champagne flute with mezcal and discard the excess. Pour chilled pomegranate juice and blood orange soda into the champagne flute, then top up with chilled champagne, and garnish with a twist of lime peel.
