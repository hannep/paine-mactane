The Canterbury’s navigator, Ade Nygaard knows what to take seriously and what not to worry about. She doesn’t dwell on the future of her clandestine relationship with Holden. But when people might be stranded in space, she advocates clearly for their rescue, knowing that humans need to stick together this far out in the darkness.
