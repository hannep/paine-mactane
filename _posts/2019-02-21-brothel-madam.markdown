The Brothel Madam runs one of the many pleasure-houses in Ceres Station’s Rosse Buurt, or “red-light district.” She has no idea [Havelock](/cocktails/2017/10/31/dimitri-havelock/) is getting language lessons from her employee, [Gia](/cocktails/1017/10/10/gia/). When she finds him alive after being impaled, she quickly seeks help, saving his life.
