The *Guanshiyin* was Jules-Pierre Mao’s pleasure yacht, a luxurious vessel that showed off his family’s riches from its sumptuous interior full of priceless art and antiques, gourmet food, and a docking bay for Julie’s own racer, to the ornate mural on the hull. 

We wanted this drink to have sophisitacated, elegant flavors - the small amounts of elderflower and passionfruit enhance the lightness of the pear brandy without obscuring it. And they're very much Earth-based items, difficult or impossible to find on Mars or in the Belt.

The cucmber garnish is mostly there to provide an aromatic balance to complement the rest of the drink. Honest! But yes, it is of course also an homage to everyone's favorite Bobbie Draper moment with the cucumber sandwiches.

We will never forget that  [@FrancoisChau](https://twitter.com/FrancoisChau) included this drink in his [international release post](https://twitter.com/FrancoisChau/status/1093767470362505217)! We may periodically scream about this, forever.

#### Instructions:

Shake the first three ingredients with ice until cold. Strain them into a champagne flute and top with 
the champagne. Twist a lemon peel over the drink to express the oils, then discard the peel. Garnish with edible gold leaf and a ribbon of cucumber.
