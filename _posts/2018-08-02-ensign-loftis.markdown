Ensign Loftis is an MCR Navy soldier who survived the near-destruction of the Kittur Chennama during a skirmish with UNN forces. She is intensely loyal to Mars and to her comrades, friends, and family there. Impulsive and brash, she tolerates no dealing with those she feels have shirked their duty.

Be warned, this drink is as intense as Lofty herself is. You may not want to throw it back all at once. Kelly McCormack, who plays Loftis, loved the drink and said it best: "Cheers to Lofty and the wicked hangover she'll deliver like a shot to the back of the head with a hilt of a gun!"
