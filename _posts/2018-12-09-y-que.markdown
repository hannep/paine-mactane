The ¿Y Qué? was a slingshot racing pod, Manéo Jung-Espinoza’s pride and joy. In it, he set new records for close approaches and un-powered transits. When news of the Ring overshadowed Manéo’s slingshot exploits, he decided on the most audacious course ever: through the Ring itself. The unforgettable result ensured his name would live forever.

We enjoyed thinking a lot about the presentation for this drink. It's served in a coupe, which has graceful curves, reminiscent of the orbital curves of a slingshotter's course. The raspberry is also symbolic: it represents Manéo's ultimate fate. (Sorry, Néo.)
