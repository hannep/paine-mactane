Lieutenant Shaffer is one of the UNN officers on the _Agatha King_ who supports Admiral Souther's investigation of Admiral Nguyen's plot. Sharp and outspoken, she conspires smoothly with Lt. Mancuso to clear the way for Souther to investigate Cotyar's claim and charge Nguyen. When the investigation becomes full-fledged mutiny against Nguyen, she fights valiantly to the very end.
