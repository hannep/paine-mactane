The Weeping Somnambulist’s captain, Melissa Suputayaporn has been toughened by life in the Belt but remains quick to care for others. Even after the Rocinante crew’s interference gets her husband, Santichai, killed, she continues aiding refugees from Ganymede as the station dies.

We didn't want to shy away from Melissa's intense bitterness, anger, and despair after her husband is killed. This drink contains a potent mix of bitter Aperol and sour lime, with dark rum's complexity to fill it out and make it an enjoyable sipper. 

Note: We're not happy about doing a measurement like ⅜ of a part, but we tried this with ¼ and it was too little lime, and ½ was too much.
