The Canterbury would have broken down long ago without Naomi Nagata’s engineering genius holding it together. Her quick thinking and leadership saved the crew of the Knight. As Holden’s XO aboard the Rocinante, she tries to keep him on an even keel, but she has secrets of her own.

We associated gin and marmalade with Dominique Tipper's British roots, which come through in the accent she uses when playing Naomi. The Averna adds a little bit of darkness and complexity to a refreshing drink, reminding us that Naomi is tortured by secrets from her past. 

A note on bitters: We used Bittermens Boston Bittahs here, and would definitely recommend them as the right ingredient for this cocktail.
