The MCRN Scirocco is an assault cruiser assigned to the outer system, with a platoon of Marines as well as weaponry. It prevented the UNN Nathan Hale from reaching Phoebe Station by destroying the entire moon. Under the command of Lieutenant Sutton, it was involved in the Ganymede Incident, where it sustained heavy damage and casualties.

This drink shares its rye base with [Lt. Sutton](/cocktails/2017/11/07/lt-sutton/), its steadfast, restrained commander.
