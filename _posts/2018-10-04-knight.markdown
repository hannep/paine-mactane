The Knight was one of the Canterbury’s shuttles, which was in sufficiently good condition when the Cant received the Scopuli’s distress call to take five crewmembers to investigate. After the Cant’s destruction, the Knight barely weathered the debris field and was eventually captured by the Donnager.

Note that, just like the *Cant*, this drink has brown crème de cacao as an ingredient. 

We think a low ABV rating is appropriate for a little, bitty shuttle with no Epstein Drive and not much power.

#### Instructions:

Pour crème de cacao and Fernet into a rocks glass and stir. Add ice, then pour seltzer water in to fill up glass and stir briefly again.
