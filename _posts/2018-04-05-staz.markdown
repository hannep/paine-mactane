A large, imposing man, Staz is an OPA member and leader of a squad in the assault on Thoth Station. He befriends Diogo and even Miller with his friendly barfly demeanor. Eventually, he leads a coup attempt against Fred Johnson, attempting to take over Tycho and use Johnson’s missiles against Earth.

This was a drink we developed on one of the rare occasions we get to see one another in person. We were trying to think of the most intense, painful combination of liquors, and settled on overproof rum and Fireball whiskey. As we looked down at our concoction, Iro announced: "I volunteer as tribute!" And downed it. Kai gave the classic Hunger Games salute (almost like a Belter gesture of respect, but off by one finger), and we're still laughing about it.
