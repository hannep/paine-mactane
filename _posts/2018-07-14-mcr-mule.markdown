The Mars Congressional Republic was formed as Mars broke away from Earth, at the same time as Solomon Epstein invented his Drive. For the past 150 years, the MCR and UN have been engaged in a cold war diverting Mars’ resources away from its dreams of a habitable surface.

We had fun with food-safe luster dust (available at craft and cake decorating shops) to make this drink look like the surface of Mars.
