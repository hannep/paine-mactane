Solomon Epstein was a Martian engineer, tinkering with drive efficiency improvements on his second-hand yacht. When he stumbled on a massive power increase, he was unable to stop his own ship from speeding out of the system. Solomon's wife Katie reconstructed the drive from Solomon's notes, giving humanity access to the Asteroid Belt and beyond.

In our hint for Solomon Epstein, we said his favorite Broadway musical would be _Grease_, and quoted the line "With a four speed on the floor they'll be waiting at the door..." from the song "Greased Lightning".
