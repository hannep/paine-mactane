The *Guy Molinari* is a Belter freighter secretly owned by the Tycho faction of the OPA. It claimed the *Rocinante* was a loose cargo container on approach to Protogen’s *Thoth Station*, allowing both ships to get close before opening fire. It later delivered an OPA demolitions team to Eros to destroy its docks before the *Nauvoo* could push it into the sun.

We had fun creating this drink as kind of a cross between the Staten Island Ferry and Airmail cocktails, with grapefruit juice and sudachi added for extra terásh ("thrust" or "power" in LangBelta).

There is a Staten Island Ferry boat named the *Guy V. Molinari* (after its former Borough President, a man we wouldn't endorse). We've been tracking its movements since we thought of this drink a few months ago, and it may be carrying passengers [right now](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/shipid:430262/zoom:10)!

You've probably heard of the Manhattan cocktail, but the other four boroughs of [@ItReachesOut](https://twitter.com/itreachesout)'s home NYC have them, too. The Staten Island Ferry, with coconut rum and pineapple juice, is the laziest "tropical" drink possible - because although SI is an island, it's decidedly un-tropical.

The Airmail inspiration came in because of the FedEx shipping container "breaching pods" the Guy Molinari carries Belter troops in on its way to Thoth Station. The Airmail is also a tropical drink, with rum and lime (we liked sudachi for its added complexity) in its ingredients.
