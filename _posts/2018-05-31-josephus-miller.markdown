A cynical detective from Ceres assigned to find Julie Mao. His search leads him away from everything he’s known before, and ends with him finding things he never dreamed of.

We're particularly proud of the fact that the Josephus Miller and [The Investigator](/cocktails/2018/05/31/the-investigator/) are the exact same drink, just with the base liquor swapped out - and that the swap works from a brown, solid-seeming liquor to a clear, ethereal one.

#### Instructions:

<strong>Searching Syrup:</strong> Mix 2 parts pisco, 1 part pear brandy, 1 part tonic syrup.

<strong>Cocktail:</strong> Stir bourbon & syrup with ice in a mixing glass until cold; strain into a chillled rocks glass with 1 large cube. No garnish. 

Stir all ingredients over ice in a mixing glass, then strain into an ice-filled rocks glass. No garnish.
