Despite living in poverty on the streets on Basic Income, Nico dedicates himself to helping others. His dream of a formal medical education is lost, but he won’t let anything stop him from providing care to those around him. His compassion, ingenuity, and complexity are plain to see, even to a Martian Marine.

We wanted this to be smooth and kind-feeling, with complexity. We like the Frangelico because hazelnuts are connected with wisdom in Irish Celtic lore.

This is a great drink for ending a cozy evening with sweetness.
