When [Alex](/cocktails/2018/03/08/alex-kamal/) is telling stories of his piloting exploits in the Blauwe Blome after the [*Roci*](/cocktails/2019/02/07/rocinante/) helps save Earth in the Eros Incident, no one is more attentive or adoring than the Belter Hottie, who tells him he needs better things to think about. Even after her boyfriend is pounded into the deck by Amos, she knows how to find a fun time.

This drink is designed to be a chaser for #79, the [Grimy Belter](/cocktails/2019/03/21/grimy-belter/). (Or you can have a few sips of this, then slam Grimy as a brief interloper, and then finish up with the rest of this one... like what happened with Alex!)

#### Instructions:

Pour all ingredients into a cocktail shaker with ice and shake until cold. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass and garnish with a pineapple wedge. Drink as a chaser to the [Grimy Belter](/cocktails/2019/03/21/grimy-belter/), Cocktail #79.
