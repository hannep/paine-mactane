It reaches out 113 times a second, but nothing answers. So it builds the Investigator and the Investigator looks, but he does not find, so it kills the Investigator. It reaches out. 

We're particularly proud of the fact that the [Josephus Miller](/cocktails/2018/05/31/josephus-miller/) and the Investigator are the exact same drink, just with the base liquor swapped out - and that the swap works from a brown, solid-seeming liquor to a clear, ethereal one.

The Investigator will work better if you make it with a New World gin, such as Ethereal, New York's Half Moon, or San Francisco's Bummer & Lazarus, rather than a standard London dry gin.

Bonus: Take The Investigator into a dark room with a UV light. It'll glow Protomolecule blue!
