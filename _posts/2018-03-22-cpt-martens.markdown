Captain Martens pretends to be a caring chaplain, but he is really an ingelligence officer for the MCRN. He is dedicated to Mars and willing to do anything to ensure its security - including using Martian Marines as test targets and scapegoats to cover up the ultra-secret Project Caliban.

This drink is designed to combine a little sweetness - Martens initially tries to seem kind and caring, almost to the point of syrupy condescension - with extreme bitterness and even a sinister feeling. We like the red clouds that descend from the foam as the drink sits. 

Sharp-eyed folks may have noted that we usually use bourbon or rye for Martian military officers and vets. But we both agreed and even insisted that does NOT fit for Martens. He's far too slippery and weak.

#### Instructions:

<strong>Bitter Campari Foam:</strong> Dry shake 1 part egg white, 1 part Campari, ⅛ part Peychaud’s bitters, and 2 dashes Angostura bitters for 20 seconds, then add ice and shake again. Use a spoon to scoop only the foam for garnish.

<strong>Cocktail:</strong> Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into an ice-filled rocks glass. Cover the top of the drink with the foam.
