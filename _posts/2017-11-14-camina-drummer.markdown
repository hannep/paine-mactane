Tycho Station’s Assistant Director of Operations, Drummer is unshakably loyal to Fred Johnson. Drummer is skilled in administration, electronics, leading combat missions, and surviving violent OPA faction disputes. She cares deeply about her Belter identity and reminds others of theirs.

After we made this drink, Cara Gee (who plays Drummer) said she was glad it contained tequila, but surprised it was mixed with anything other than the tears of her enemies. Sadly, we couldn't find those in our local liquor stores.
