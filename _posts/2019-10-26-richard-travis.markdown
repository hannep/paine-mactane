Private Richard Travis is a Martian Marine assigned to Roberta Draper’s squad aboard the MCRN _Scirocco_. He emigrated from Earth at age 5 and is viciously bullied by his  squadmates for not being Martian-born, but he staunchly defends his loyalty to Mars. Later, Martian intelligence tries to frame him for initiating the Ganymede Incident.

In our hint for Richard Travis, we said his favorite Broadway musical would be _Hamilton_, and quoted the line "Immigrants — we get the job done!" from the song "Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)".
