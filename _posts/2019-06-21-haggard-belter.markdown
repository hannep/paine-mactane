One of the few survivors of the Eros horror, the Haggard Belter escapes on the [*Roci*](/cocktails/2019/02/07/rocinante/). He doesn’t trust the crew at first, fearing that he and other refugees will be spaced even if they aren’t infected. His concern over the fates of those left behind makes a powerful impression on [Alex](/cocktails/2018/03/08/alex-kamal/), motivating him to care more strongly about doing the right thing.

#### Instructions:

<strong>Caramel Syrup:</strong> Heat 2 cups sugar and 1 cup water in a deep saucepan until the mixture reaches 348°F. Immediately remove from heat and add 1 cup hot water. Return to heat and stir constantly until the caramel is completely dissolved and the mixture is smooth, about 1 minute. 

<strong>Cocktail:</strong> Muddle all ingredients in a mixing glass. Add ice and stir until cold. Double strain into a rocks glass over ice; garnish with a kiwi slice and a mint leaf.
