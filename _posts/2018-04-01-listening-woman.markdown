After a hard day as flight controller for the Tycho docks, this woman just wanted to relax at a bar. Instead, she got roped into listening to Alex’s rant­­ - it’s hard to turn down free drinks. (Okay, we don’t really know her back-story, but we wish we did!)

At the time, we thought making drinks for extremely minor characters with few lines and no names was a good joke. Now, we've done a whole series of Scene Stealers, and the Listening Woman, with her hilarious facial expressions and deadpan delivery, would definitely make the list.

This drink was later served, with fresh passionfruit and some other modifications, at the [Belter Bar](http://twitter.com/BelterBar) at Worldcon 2018! It was very popular as the "Above the Ecliptic," and we smelled like fresh passionfruit for what felt like days.
