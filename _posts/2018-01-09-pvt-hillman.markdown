Daughter of one of the richest families on Mars, Hillman is a tough Martian Marine with an attitude problem. Her prejudice against her Earth-born comrade often divides her squad, but she’s a good soldier when necessary.

Private Hillman was a continuous annoyance on her squad, but her drink has become a favorite. We initially added the chipotle for its flavor, to bring out the fiery, hostile elements of Hilly's personality, but we like how the final appearance is reminiscent of her beloved Martian soil. 

The egg white is partly to bind things together (and provides a great base for the chipotle!), but we first thought of putting it in because something "frothy" was appropriate for Hillman's antagonism. We didn't want too much, though: Hilly's verbal jabs are sharp and calculated.

#### Instructions:

<strong>Grapefruit-Ginger Syrup:</strong> Bring 1 cup fresh grapefruit juice, 2 tbsp grapefruit zest, 1½ tbsp sugar, and 1 inch peeled ginger sliced into ⅛-inch pieces to high boil for 10 minutes (will reduce to ¼ cup). Cool before use.

<strong>Cocktail:</strong> Put cocktail ingredients into a shaker and dry shake for 10-15 seconds. Add ice and shake again until chilled. Strain into a coupe and garnish with ground chipotle.
