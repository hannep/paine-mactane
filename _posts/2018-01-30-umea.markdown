Umea is one of the highest-ranking operatives in Project Caliban, a top-secret Protogen research project. When one of her super-soldier creations mortally wounds her, she is unrepentant to the last, proudly telling the Roci crew that her team “made the Protomolecule in our own image.”

We always knew this drink needed a bunch of lime; Umea is pretty sour. And we were sure of a clear liquor. There was some debate over tequila, but then the suggestion of specifically New World gin resolved that. So don't use London dry; it hasn't got enough body to portray her ferocity as she dies.

#### Instructions:

Place all ingredients into a mixing glass with ice. Stir until chilled, then strain into a rocks glass over a single large ice cube. Garnish with a thin, wide slice of Granny Smith apple.
