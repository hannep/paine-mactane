The UNS Arboghast is a science vessel sent to Venus to unravel the mysteries of the Eros crash site. The Protomolecule decides to investigate the Arboghast instead. Its final fate is referred to as anything from deconstruction to disaggregation.

Is this just a deconstructed [B-52](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-52_(cocktail))? Yes it is. Are we as clever as we think we are? Definitely not. 

Happy April Fool's Day!
