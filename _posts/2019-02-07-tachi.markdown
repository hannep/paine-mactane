The MCRN *Tachi* was a gunship on the *Donnager*, used by the survivors of the *Cant* to escape from its destruction by Protogen stealth ships. 

This drink shares influences from Mars in general, and from [Lt. Lopez](/cocktails/2017/12/19/lt-lopez/), who gives his life to get the *Canterbury* survivors to its safety. Later, it keeps its base spirit, but undergoes a tremendous transformation to become a non-military home for 4 misfits.
