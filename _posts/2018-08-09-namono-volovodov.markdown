Namono “Nono” Volovodov is Anna’s wife and partner in their clinic in St. Petersburg, where they care for the undocumented who have slipped through the gaps in Earth’s safety net. Caring for their daughter while Anna is away, Nono is Anna’s rock of stability and voice of reason.

In this drink, the one big ice cube symbolizes the way Nono is a rock of stability for Anna.

We had too much fun saying "Namono" and "Nonino" in quick succession while coming up with this recipe. (Putting Nonino in it wasn't based on her name, just the right ingredient for the drink. We noticed the similarity later.)
