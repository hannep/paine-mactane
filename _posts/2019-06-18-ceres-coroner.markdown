The Ceres Coroner is a matter-of-fact guy, unceremonious about his work and everything it entails. Some days there’s more work than others — like after a riot in the Medina. But he takes it all in stride, and always checks to see if his latest stiff has a religious directive on file before feeding them into the recycler. He is one step in the Belter cycle of life. 

We wanted this drink to have the same attitude as the Coroner: An easygoing base of cachaça (think chilling with a caipirinha on a hot day) with a dose of the morbid and unsettling in the form of an absinthe rinse.

We added some complex plant-y flavors with the herbaceous Chartreuse and sharp-smelling oregano, and we like how the garnish reminds us of a jaunty seedling sprouting from nutrient-rich recycled human remains.

#### Instructions:

Pour all ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until cold. Rinse a chilled rocks glass with absinthe, discard the excess, strain the mixture into the glass over ice, and garnish with a sprig of fresh oregano.
