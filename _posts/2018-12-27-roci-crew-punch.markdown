The crew of the Rocinante began as individuals from diverse backgrounds across the Solar System and became a family that had profound effects on the history of all humanity. Earther, Martian & Belter; engineer, pilot, mechanic & captain, all work together in a whole that’s far more than the sum of its parts.

Oleo saccharum is easy to make, helps you use parts of citrus fruit that might otherwise go unused, and rounds out the taste and feel of cocktail this cocktail - or other drinks, so try experimenting with it!

If you use too much sugar, add the whole bowl to hot water, juice, or a large-format cocktail recipe and let the rest of the liquid dissolve it, straining out the peels afterward. (This is done intentionally in the [Screaming Firehawks](/cocktails/2018/12/screaming-firehawks/) mulled wine recipe, which is both sweeter and easier.)

To make a truly excellent lemonade concentrate, add lemon juice to the oleo saccharum and keep it in your fridge. Pour over ice and top with water or seltzer whenever you feel like a glass. This is also great with other citrus fruits, alone or mixed together.

Ready to toast to the new year? In #LangBelta, that's: Tenye wa yitim gut! Milowda du xop da 2019 tolowda im xush. ("We hope your 2019 is happy.")

#### Instructions:

<strong>Oleo Saccharum:</strong> Oleo saccharum, or sugared oil, adds complex, intense citrus flavor and satisfying mouthfeel to cocktails from punches to Old Fashioneds to lemonade. It’s a great way to use the whole fruit around your home bar and kitchen instead of just the juice. Try experimenting with various citrus fruits for different drinks - this method is very forgiving.

Remove the citrus zest in long strips using a vegetable peeler, avoiding the bitter, white pith as much as possible. Muddle with the sugar and toss to evenly coat, then leave at room temperature in a covered bowl overnight. The sugar will draw the oil out of the peels, collecting it in the bottom of the bowl.

Strain the oil-and-fruit compound the next day, pressing all the liquid out of the sugared peels, and store the result in the refrigerator until it’s ready for use.Makes approximately ⅓ cup of oleo saccharum.

<strong>Cocktail:</strong> Combine all ingredients in a large pitcher or punch bowl filled with ice and stir until very cold. Serve in punch cups or glasses and garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.
