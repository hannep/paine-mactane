The Slingshot Club Bookie in Bizi Betiko’s hole on Ceres is a particularly charming example of his kind. His patter is audible from the entryway, reassuring gamblers of good action, and he’s happy to smoothly solicit bets from a Star Helix officer even while telling him the man he’s looking for is dying somewhere near Jupiter.
