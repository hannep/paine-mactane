Shed Garvey is the _Canterbury_'s chief medic. He provides the best care he can despite having no medical degree. Motivated by compassion, he's always ready to offer drugs to help ease people's stress or pain. When Alex has lost oxygen aboard the _Knight_, Shed uses his own air to keep Alex alive. He often uses humor to defuse tense situations.

For this drink, we used a clear, fresh-tasting apple brandy from Gardiner Liquid Mercantile, a distillery Iro has visited. It has an especially clean apple flavor compared to most Calvados or applejack we've tried, and went well with the fresh cream taste of Bailey's. We sometimes make our own Irish Cream, which would be especially comforting and delicious here, but didn't have any on hand for this recipe and it turned out fine anyway.
