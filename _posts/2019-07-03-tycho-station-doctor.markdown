The Station Doctor on Tycho is the doctor that Fred Johnson and Camina Drummer go to when they need medical advice or care. She proves her capability and cool-headedness in unexpected situations from emergency triage and first aid in low-G to regrowing a spine to analyzing Protogen’s unethical brain treatments.
