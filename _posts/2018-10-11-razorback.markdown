The Razorback was Julie Mao’s personal, custom racing yacht, far more engine than crew compartment or anything else. After Errinwright betrayed Jules-Pierre Mao and ordered the destruction of the Guanshiyin, Bobbie Draper used the Razorback to fly Avasarala and herself to safety, outracing missiles and gunships.

It's easy to get crisp, clear layers in this drink, especially between the grenadine and grapefruit. We deliberately messed up that border a little for our photo, just so the gradient would look more like the actual *Razorback*.

We knew we'd gotten this drink right when it made us say, "That was like having something really fast and powerful go whooshing right over your head and ruffle your hair!"

#### Instructions:

Pour the grenadine into the bottom of a shot glass. Pouring over the back of a spoon, layer the grapefruit juice onto the grenadine. Repeat with overproof rum, forming a third layer on top. Drink as a single shot.
