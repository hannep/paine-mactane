Though he can appear friendly and even harmless when he wants to, Kenzo has a hidden side. He is a spy, highly skilled in infiltration, corporate espionage, electronic sabotage, and tracking others. Kenzo can talk his way out of almost any situation.

This drink is "friendly" at first - sweet, fruity and dangerously easy to drink - but then has a suspiciously dark flavor once you start to notice it. The bitterness comes from the Aperol and from the smell of the lemon peel and bitters on top of the drink.

1 egg white is typically 1 ounce in volume. Depending on the size of your coupe glass, using 1 part = 1 ounce may get you two drinks' worth. Share it with a friend... or an enemy.
