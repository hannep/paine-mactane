Ren Hazuki manages a team of technicians for Savage Industries aboard the UNN Thomas Prince. A veteran with the company, he’s an expert at doing the minimum possible amount of work for his paycheck, but he cares about his team and tries to mentor them in their careers.

This is a really easy recipe. We worried we were kind of phoning it in... but that's what Ren would do, so it fits the character just right.
