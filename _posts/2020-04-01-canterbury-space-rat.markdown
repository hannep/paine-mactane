The old ice-hauler _Canterbury_ exists in a state of constant disrepair. Its creaky, grimy decks harbor the Solar System’s stubborn oddballs, rejects, and fugitives, including one tenacious brown rat. Does Space Rat have a family? During high-G maneuvers, does Space Rat snuggle into a spare crash couch? So many questions keeping us up at night.

Holden shares a moment with Space Rat during one of his many insomniac nights on the flight deck. This drink is the anti-coffee, with complexity, warmth, and sweetness to get you dozing off in your crash couch after a long day. Choosing the glass and garnish for this one was fun— the sugar and smoked salt rim is delicious, but against the metallic gradient on this tumbler it also reminds us of the dilapidated bulkheads of the _Cant_. Room-temperature drinks are uncommon but have a rich history as bitter and sweet digestifs, showing off the flavors of each component. Pick a bourbon you like! After deciding to make this one room temperature, we realized it's the perfect format for this character: The _Cant_ gets paid for all the ice it hauls, so no one would spare a cube for Space Rat!

#### Instructions:

Rim a tumbler with a mix of Demerara sugar and smoked salt in equal parts, brushing away any stray sugar or salt that falls into the glass. Add all ingredients and stir to combine. Serve at room temperature with no ice.
