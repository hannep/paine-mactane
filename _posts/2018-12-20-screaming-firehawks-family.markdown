The Screaming Firehawks are a family of choice, drawn together by our love of The Expanse and the values it promotes: the need for people of different backgrounds and viewpoints to understand each other and work together, and the power of friendship and love to overcome boundaries and obstacles.

We recommend a Bordeaux blend for the wine, You can use pre-ground spices if you want - start with a pinch of each and go up from there, as flavor intensity varies with age.

For a non-alcoholic version, this is also yummy with a whole half-gallon of cider and no wine, but drop the sugar to only ¼ cup.

This recipe is designed to use only things you can get at a standard grocery store, and to be relatively low in alcohol for relaxed and cozy gatherings. The next one is more suitable for a party - get your punch bowls ready!

#### Instructions:

Lightly crush 1 cinnamon stick, 1 clove nutmeg, 6 allspice berries, 3 cloves, 2 bay leaves, 
and 2 star anise. Using a vegetable peeler, zest the lemon and clementines, removing as little of the white pith as possible. Place zest in a bowl with the sugar, muddle, and set aside for 30 minutes. Juice the clementines. Combine all ingredients and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low for 15 minutes. To serve, strain and garnish with apple and clementine slices.
