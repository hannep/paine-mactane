With advanced degrees in genetics, biology, and nanoinformatics, Dr. Lawrence Strickland is the brains behind Project Caliban. He puts up a sweet and gentle façade in front of the children he’s using as test subjects, but actually has no human empathy at all.

As with all villain drinks, we worked hard to make a tasty drink - for each drink, we drink a full-sized one and if afterward we would immediately order and pay for a second one at a bar, the recipe can be published - that doesn't let you forget that it's a drink representing someone evil. 

Similar to Captain Martens [link to his drink], Dr. Strickland hides his self-serving cruelty behind a sickly-sweet mask. Although he acts gentle with the children entrusted to his care, he's really using them in Protogen's scheme to infect them with Protomolecule and use them as weapons. He doesn't waver in his enthusiasm for the "Project" when even Jules-Pierre Mao objects to its inhumanity. 

This drink begins sweet, with *two* types of sherry plus honey syrup, but evolves into bitter complexity with two bitter orange amari: Amer Picon, a French aperitif, and Campari, the Italian favorite for spritzes and sbagliati. Surprisingly drinkable while being obviously evil!
