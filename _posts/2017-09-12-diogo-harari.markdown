No one who knows this young, hot-headed OPA revolutionary can deny that he also has an endearing sweetness to him. His rock-hoppper childhood and criminal past on Ceres taught him to stay cool on the most dangerous zero-g missions, but he has an endless enthusiasm for life. 

We enjoyed making a cocktail that tasted fiery, enthusiastic, and a little reckless - like our Diogo. The drink has no garnish, to represent the way Diogo hasn't quite found his place in the world.  

Later, our work paid off in the most awesome way: Andrew Rotilio stopped by our Black Moon [popup bar](http://twitter.com/BelterBar), and we made a round of Diogo cocktails for everyone in the room! He put us on the spot to tell us about our interpretation of his character, and loved his drink.

#### Instructions:

Lightly muddle the cucumber slices and lime juice 
in a shaker.  Rub the rim of a chilled coupe vigorously with a ¼” slice of fresh, peeled ginger root. Add the other ingredients and ice to the shaker. Shake until chilled and double strain to exclude pulp.
