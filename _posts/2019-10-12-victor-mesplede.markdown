In the wake of the Eros Station infection and quarantine, Victor Mesplede leads activists from Aid Without Allegiance to break into the station and provide medical relief to survivors. Idealistic but not naïve, he is a quick thinker who sees through the _Rocinante_'s disguise and tries to use orbital maneuvers to escape.

Victor Mesplede is a man proudly without a faction, wielding his concerned expression and above-the-fray attitude as a knife to cut through red tape and a shield against the consequences of dangerous actions. We combined the sharp flavors of pineapple and chartreuse and the slightly savory scent of Makrut lime leaf (often referred to as Kaffir lime, though we learned that name has a pejorative history) with grounded, smooth pisco and a comforting, peace-white blanket of coconut milk.
