With the first speaking role in the series, the “Gaunt Belter” is a revolutionary man of the people.  His prickly, OPA-tattooed exterior and his frothy rhetoric are often polarizing, but his caring for Ceres’ Belter community is well-respected in the Medina even when his attitude is a little sour.  

We knew we had to start off our series with the first character who speaks and introduces us to the Expanse universe. We got a little punny in our drink description, too! After we posted, we got so many requests for more and questions about whether we had more planned. People had no idea, and honestly neither did we, that we'd be crossing into the triple digits eventually!
