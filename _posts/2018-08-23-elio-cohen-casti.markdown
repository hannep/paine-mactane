Elio Casti, known better simply as “Cohen,” is Monica Stuart’s camera operator as she films a documentary on the Roci crew. With fluid, eerie gestures, he sends his camera drones all over the ship, prying into the crew’s secrets. His journalistic curiosity puts the entire ship in danger.

We tried to make the drink reflect Cohen’s attempts to ingratiate himself by acting very smooth and a little sweet, but also his intrusiveness.

We don't usually like to specify brands, but in this case, the Hendrick's gin is necessary to provide a bit more cucumber flavor. And that cucumber helps make the whole thing taste nice and cool, as Cohen is a fairly cool customer.

That said, if you're looking for brands, we used Domaine de Canton for the ginger liqueur and Midori for the melon liqueur, so using those will get you a drink that's just like ours.
