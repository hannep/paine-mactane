We rarely see what’s involved in keeping a station the size of Tycho running, but the Grimy Belter brings that reality into the comfort of the Blauwe Blome bar - after working double shifts in a recycler. Without technicians like him, the entire ecosystem would break down. When he finds his girlfriend kissing [Alex](/cocktails/2018/03/08/alex-kamal/), he starts a bar fight that Amos quickly stops.

This drink is designed to be followed up with #78, the [Belter Hottie](/cocktails/2019/03/21/belter-hottie/), as a chaser. (Or you can have a few sips of Hottie, then slam this as an interloper and finish up with the rest of the Hottie... as happened to Alex!)

#### Instructions:

Brush the rim of a shot glass with sudachi juice and rim it with smoked salt. Pour all ingredients into a shaker and shake with ice until cold. Strain into the rimmed shot glass. Chase it with the [Belter Hottie](/cocktails/2019/03/21/belter-hottie/), Cocktail #78.
