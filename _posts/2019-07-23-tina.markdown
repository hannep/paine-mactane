The bartender at the Blauwe Blome bar on Tycho Station, Tina puts up with her customers' antics for awhile, taking shots as "tips", but has no qualms about kicking people out when she gets tired of them. She keeps rowdy Belters in line with everything from witty banter to a stun zapper. When Diogo becomes a hero in the Eros Incident, she gives him a special reward.

In our hint for Tina, we described her as: stylish, fierce, long-suffering, streetwise, and saucy.
