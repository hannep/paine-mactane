After too long in the depths of space, in the big black of the Outer Planets, a man’s mind can wander. It can wander too far. That’s what happened to the guy who was the [Canterbury](/cocktails/2018/09/13/canterbury/)’s XO before Holden. First he started talking to his plants. Then he started walking on his plants. But shooting out screens with a six gun was too far.

We designed this drink to have a variety of earthy and botanical flavors, befitting the character's connection with plants and soil, but to take them out of the brighter, sweeter context we often find those flavors in.

The result is a colder and harsher backdrop for the apple, caraway, and herbs, like the XO's plants aboard a ship far out in space, though it's definitely an enjoyable drink. 

The aquavit/Calvados combination is unusual, and it took us some work to get it balanced.

When composing the photo for this drink, we were struck by how lonely the sage leaf looked, floating on top of a block of ice. That couldn't be more appropriate.

#### Instructions:

Pour all ingredients into a rocks glass over a single large ice cube and stir briefly to combine and chill them. Garnish with a fresh sage leaf.
