A veteran of the Vesta Blockade, Admiral Nguyễn is an aggressive hawk who distrusts Mars and fears its capabilities. He can be relied on to advise first strikes and strong shows of force. The rule of law is merely an impediment to him, standing in the way of his desire for all-out war.

We like that this drink has the same presentation style as the Souther, and one ingredient in common (they are, after all, both top-level admirals in the UNN), but they are otherwise extremely different.

#### Instructions:

Stir all ingredients over ice in a mixing glass, then strain into an ice-filled rocks glass. No garnish.
