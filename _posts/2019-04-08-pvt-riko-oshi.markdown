One of the MCR Marines assigned to the *Xuesen*, Pvt. Riko Oshi is more than just muscle. She’s a skilled drop ship pilot, and perceptive enough to quickly grasp  the logistical and humanitarian problems imposed on everyone in the Slow Zone by the lowered speed limit. But none of that stops her from being a hand-to-hand badass who goes up against Bobbie Draper herself when the need arises.
