Protogen research head Antony Dresden used his empathy-removal technique to turn the entire research team into sociopaths with no regard for other people. He has ambitions to re-shape humanity with the protomolecule, and his seductive logic sways even otherwise clear-headed people.

We decided early on that Dresden was a clear liquor, and an icy result. We like how the lemon oils don't just tweak the taste of the drink, they also give a slight, oily sheen as they float on top, making the whole drink look more sinister. 

Prepare this drink as Dresden would prepare a science experiment. Spritz in the absinthe and express the lemon oils with calculated precision, and then discard whatever isn't useful to the Project.

We wanted this drink to be slightly disturbing, like Dresden himself, but also drinkable. And we wanted it to be more and more palatable the more you drink it, like Dresden's logic slowly convincing everyone (except Miller).

We enjoyed using our local favorites for this drink's New World gin. Here are some we like: Bummer & Lazarus or St. George's Botanivore from SF; Half Moon, Brooklyn, or Dorothy Parker from NY. You should stay away from London Dry gins here, they don't have enough funky complexity.

#### Instructions:

Pour the gin, mezcal, and vermouth into a mixing glass over ice. Stir until very cold. Prepare a chilled cocktail glass by spritzing absinthe into it with an atomizer to coat the inside; discard any excess. Pour the drink into the cocktail glass. Twist a lemon peel over the drink to express oils, then discard the peel.
