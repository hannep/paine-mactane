[Miller](/cocktails/2018/05/31/josephus-miller/) is a hard-boiled detective with no desire for companionship. But when he goes to Eros for the last time, he acquires a pet 4.5 kiloton fission bomb. It’s very needy, requiring constant attention, but he faithfully lugs it with him all the way to his final destination, where Julie gives it a critical pat with her Protomolecule-enhanced hand.

We always knew the Miller's Pet Nuke drink had to be something special. To be honest, this drink was the inspiration for this entire April Fool's series: not just pets, but pets that are all *not actual, living animals*.

The base is mostly bourbon, for [Miller](/cocktails/2018/05/31/josephus-miller/) as a hard-drinking, noir detective. Then we added some rum, which goes well with the fruitiness of the peppercorns - and also because the bomb was supplied by the OPA.

The cooling, numbing feeling of the Sichuan peppercorns is intended to be like the "freezing" effect when Julie puts her hand on the nuke's screen.

The infusion time and amount should be right to give you a little tingle on your lips and tongue, without overwhelming the overall flavor of the drink. Pick your infusion time in that 18-24 hour range according to your tolerance for Sichuan peppercorn.

We hope you like the special "cup" we served this in for the photo!
