Egan is an OPA soldier in the [*Behemoth*](/cocktails/2018/11/29/opas-behemoth/)’s brig, responsible for guarding [Holden](/cocktails/2018/04/12/james-holden/). When [Drummer](/cocktails/2017/11/14/camina-drummer) leads a mission to shut down the [*Behemoth*](/cocktails/2018/11/29/opas-behemoth/)’s reactor, he refuses to be left behind, declaring his loyalty and reminding her of what they’ve been through together. He doesn’t flinch even when [Diogo](/cocktails/2017/09/12/diogo-harari/) barrels down on him in stolen MMC power armor.
