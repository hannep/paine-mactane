Colonel Janus has watched the stars since he was a boy, but has devoted his life to the UN Navy. Still, his scientific rigor serves him well as commander of the Arboghast’s mission to investigate the Eros crash site. After much debate with Dr. Iturbi, the two come to respect each other.

We always knew we needed to make Janus' and Iturbi's drinks connect to and complement each other, because of the scene where they each say, "this is the part where you'd say...", recognizing out loud how much each understands and grudgingly respects the other, and how their points of view play off one another. 

We re-watched the scene where Janus talks about how he looked at the stars as a boy and realized: He is a man of science! Even more so than flashy Iturbi, in some ways. We developed serious respect for him. 

Not only do both drinks have Allspice Dram, but the fig bitters in Janus call back to the notes of fig in the sherry in Iturbi. They go well together... like the characters.
