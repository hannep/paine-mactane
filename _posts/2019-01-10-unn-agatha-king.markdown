The flagship of Earth’s Jupiter fleet, the UNN *Agatha King* was aging and prone to malfunctions. Admiral Nguyễn’s attempts to start a war with Mars led to a mutiny by Admiral Souther and loyal forces, followed by a quick counter-mutiny before the ship was infected by protomolecule and finally destroyed for the safety of humanity.

This cocktail pulls in various directions, as befits a ship that was the site of 2 mutinies in quick succession. The blue, butterfly pea flower float naturally represents the protomolecule infection. But it's still well balanced, despite the disparate elements.

"Rich" simple syrup means a 2:1 mixture of sugar and water instead of the standard 1:1. If you only have pre-mixed, standard-weight simple syrup, you can just use ¼ oz instead. It might make floating the flower-infused gin a bit harder, is all.

The gin is because it's a UNN vessel, as per our usual theme, but we went for a New World gin instead of London dry - partly for flavor mixing (it just blended better with the other ingredients), and partly because Nguyễn isn't really quite loyal UNN anymore.

The umeshu is a fun ingredient! It's an interesting blend of sour and sweet. You can find it in Japanese or Chinese stores, or well-stocked liquor stores.
