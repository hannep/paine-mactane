Octavia Muss is a Star Helix officer with good detective skills and steady nerves. She can track people down even when they’ve been kidnapped by the OPA, and knows how to handle the situation afterward. Unlike some other officers, she tries to uphold the law and avoid abusing her power.

We started with Kahlúa for Muss' alertness & dedication to her job, then added bourbon for the "hard-boiled cop" aspect. Cherry Heering just seemed to "fit" her, somehow, and rounded out the flavor nicely. The bitters complement the cherry & Kahlúa to make the cocktail complete.
