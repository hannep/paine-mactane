Also known as “the bouillotte dealer”, Javi is a fixture on Ceres Station, always ready to throw down some cards and engage someone in a little casual gambling action. At the same time, he’s very knowledgeable about politics, current events, and the social effects those events have on the people of the Belt.

#### Instructions:

<strong>Rich Hibiscus Syrup:</strong> Bring 2 cups sugar and 1 cup water to a boil and remove from heat. Add 4 ounces dried hibiscus flowers and steep for 20 minutes. Strain, pressing the liquid through the saturated petals. Store in an airtight container up to 6 months.

<strong>Cocktail:</strong>  Whip ¼ cup chilled, full-fat coconut milk with 2 tsp rich hibiscus syrup. Pour cocktail ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until cold. Strain into a chilled hurricane glass with small ice cubes and garnish with hibiscus-coconut whipped cream.
